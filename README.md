# Dendrite

Column-and-card writing in Obsidian, in the style of [Gingko Writer](https://gingkowriter.com/), for manuscripts, grants and long documents. The argument sits in the left columns and the prose in the right, and export assembles the manuscript from the cards.

Dendrite keeps everything in plain notes:

- **Each card is an ordinary note**, named by an ID such as `GRANT-2026-k3f9q`.
- **A manuscript's index note holds the tree** as a nested list of links:

  ```markdown
  - [[GRANT-2026-7kq2m|Specific Aims]]
      - [[GRANT-2026-c4x9p|Aim 1]]
          - [[GRANT-2026-f81rw|Aim 1 rationale]]
  ```

Without the plugin, the index still reads as a clickable outline and every card as a note. Dendrite stores nothing about a document anywhere else.

## Install

Through [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat): add `ddtam/obsidian-dendrite` as a beta plugin.

## Use

Run **Dendrite: New manuscript**, give it a title and a prefix, and it creates:

```text
<writing folder>/<title>/
    <title>.md     the index note, with dendrite_prefix in its properties
    cards/         one note per card
```

Opening an index note shows it in Dendrite; **Index** in the view's bar opens its markdown instead. A card or index note open as markdown has a Dendrite button in its tab header, which opens the manuscript at that card.

## Writing a card

A **section card** starts with a heading line, `# Research Outline`. The `#` marks the line as a heading; its level comes from the card's depth, so you never choose it. Write numbers into headings yourself, or turn on **Number sections by position** in the manuscript's settings and leave them out: sections are then numbered from where they sit, `1.`, `1.2`, in the view and in export, and renumber when moved. The numbers are never written into your notes.

Cards are edited in Obsidian's own editor, so live preview, `[[` link suggestions, citation suggestions from other plugins, and Obsidian's editor commands and hotkeys all work inside a card. Escape leaves the card, after closing any open suggestion list first.

Obsidian has no public API for putting its editor inside another view, so Dendrite reaches it the way several plugins do, through the editor of an embedded note. If that fails, as an Obsidian update could make it, or if **Use Obsidian's editor in cards** is off, cards use a plain text box instead, which saves the same way. In the text box:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I | Bold / italic the selection |
| Tab / Shift+Tab | Indent / outdent the line, or every selected line |
| Enter in a list | Continue the list; on an empty item, end it |

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Arrow keys | Move between cards: up and down within a column, left to the parent, right to a child |
| Enter, or double-click | Edit the card |
| Escape | Save and leave the editor |
| Ctrl+↓ / Ctrl+↑ (or Ctrl+J / Ctrl+K) | New card below / above, in normal mode |
| Ctrl+→ (or Ctrl+L) | New child card, in normal mode |
| Alt+↑ / Alt+↓ | Move the card among its siblings |
| Alt+→ / Alt+← | Indent under the card above / outdent |
| Ctrl+Backspace | Delete the card and its children |
| Ctrl+Z | Undo the last structural change |

### Vim-style keys

In normal mode, shown as **NORMAL** in the bar, no card is being edited and letters are commands. **INSERT** means a card is open for writing. In insert mode every key belongs to the text, Ctrl+arrows for moving by word included, and Escape is the only way back to normal mode. They can be turned off in the settings.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| h j k l | Left to the parent, down, up, right to a child |
| i / a | Edit with the cursor at the start / at the end |
| o / O | New card below / above |
| n | New child card |
| J / K | Move the card down / up |
| > / < | Indent / outdent the card |
| dd | Delete the card and its children |
| u | Undo |
| gg / G | First / last card in the column |

**Drag a card** with the mouse or a pen to move it with its branch: over the top half of another card it goes above it, over the bottom half below it, and over the card's right edge it becomes that card's last child. An accent line shows where it will land, columns scroll near their ends, Escape cancels, and Ctrl+Z undoes a drop. A card cannot be dropped into its own branch.

On a phone, the active card's toolbar offers the same actions, and a long press opens the card's menu, which has the move and indent items.

**Text is never discarded.** A card saves while you type and again whenever you leave it, Escape included. Deleted cards go to Obsidian's trash, and Ctrl+Z restores them.

## Splitting and merging cards

While editing a card, **Move selection to a new card below** or **to a new child card** takes the selected text out of the card into a new one; with nothing selected, everything after the cursor moves. Both are in the editor's right-click menu and in the command palette, unbound, for a hotkey of your choosing. The new card is written before the text leaves the original, so a failure leaves the text twice, never nowhere. You stay in the original card, ready to move the next piece.

A card's menu offers **Merge into the card above** and **Merge into the parent card**, which join its text after the other card's and bring its children along.

Undo reverses a move or a merge in one step, but never discards text written since: a moved card you have edited is kept, and a card's text is restored only if it still holds what the change left there.

## Manuscript settings and card properties

**Settings** in the bar edits the manuscript's properties on its index note: a total limit, whether characters count spaces, words per page for page estimates, numbering, and the top heading level for export. The **sliders** button on a card edits its label and its limit.

### Quotas

A quota is in words, characters or pages, fractions allowed (`1/4 page`), and is **required** (set by the call) or a **target** (your own allocation). It is counted from what export would write for that card's branch, so planning text and comments never count.

Each card shows its quota at its bottom left as a target and a bar filled to its use. Hover it for the figures; click it to edit the quota in place. A card without a quota shows a faint target when hovered, to set one.

Quotas waterfall down the tree. A card's **allocations** are the quotas of the nearest cards below it that carry one, and its card shows both what its branch uses against its quota and what is allocated against it, free or over. The bar does the same for the manuscript's total quota. Going over a required quota shows red; over a target, amber.

Quotas in different units are compared by converting through **words per page** and **characters per word**, both manuscript settings. Pages and converted figures are estimates and are marked `~`; an exact page count needs the final layout.

| Property | Where | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dendrite_prefix` | index | the card ID prefix |
| `dendrite_limit` | index or card | a quota: `500 words`, `2000 characters`, `0.25 pages` |
| `dendrite_limit_required` | index or card | `true` if the call sets the quota |
| `dendrite_chars_per_word` | index | for comparing character quotas, default 6 |
| `dendrite_count_spaces` | index | `false` to count characters without spaces |
| `dendrite_words_per_page` | index | for page estimates, default 500 |
| `dendrite_number_sections` | index | `true` to number sections by position |
| `dendrite_heading_top` | index | the heading level of a top-level section |

## Other plugins

Cards are ordinary notes, so any plugin that rewrites notes acts on them too. The [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin's "File name heading" rule would insert a card's ID as its heading, so Dendrite adds the writing folder to Linter's **Folders to ignore**, once and with a notice. It removes only an entry it added itself, and the setting **Keep Linter out of the writing folder** turns this off.

Linter's clean-up still reaches cards, through Dendrite: when you leave a card you changed, Dendrite runs Linter on it with "File name heading" and "Capitalize headings" switched off for that run, so blank lines, emphasis markers and list markers are tidied as on save. **Clean up cards with Linter** turns this off. It uses Linter's internal `runLinterFile`; if a Linter update removes it, cards are simply left unlinted.

## Labels

The index shows each card by a label: the card's heading line if it starts with one, else the first of its `aliases`, else its first words. Dendrite keeps the index's labels in step with the cards, so edit a label in the card, not in the index.

## What prints: card roles

Each card has a role, which decides what of it prints:

| Role | Prints | Default for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heading only | its heading line; the rest of its text is notes | a card with children |
| Full text | its heading, if any, and its text | a card without children |
| Left out | nothing from the card or its branch | never by default |

Set a card's role from its right-click menu; it is stored as `dendrite_role` (`section`, `prose` or `notes`) on the card. An outline card in the first column, holding a heading and your notes, is set to **Heading only** so its notes stay out even before it has children. A left-out card shows with a dashed outline; a heading-only card shows its notes muted. `%% comments %%` never print.

## Card status

A card's status describes its text, and every card that prints holds one, as `dendrite_status`, so each card says what it is without Dendrite; cards that do not print hold none. Opening a manuscript gives `draft` to any printing card without a status.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| draft | written, not yet worked over (the default) |
| done | "I like where this is; leave it" |
| revise | needs another pass, from your own read or a reviewer's comment |
| unsplit | set by Dendrite on a card whose text you started moving into children and left some behind |

Only revise and unsplit are coloured, as flags: a chip on the card and a faint bar in the preview. Done shows a quiet tick; draft shows nothing. A section, which prints only its heading, shows how many cards below it are flagged. The bar tallies the statuses, so near submission the draft count is what is left.

**+** marks the active card done and **−** sends it to revise; **]** and **[** go to the next and previous flagged card, and a command goes to the next draft. Moved text keeps its card's status, and a merge keeps the less mature of the two. A card that stops printing, because it gained children, loses its status; unsplit clears itself once only the heading and comments are left, or with **Keep the leftover text as notes**.

Colours come from the [Pretty Properties](https://github.com/anareaty/pretty-properties) plugin, if it gives `dendrite_status` values a colour, so the Properties panel and the board agree.

## Preview

**Preview** in the bar opens the manuscript as export would print it, beside the board, updating as cards save. Each card's part is its own block: click one to select that card on the board, double-click to edit it, and the board's active card is highlighted in the preview. **Show left out** also shows, dimmed, the text that does not print, so you can check what your roles leave out. Editing stays in the cards, since the printed text is transformed (headings levelled and numbered, notes and comments dropped).

## Export

**Export** in the view's toolbar, or **Export this branch** in a card's menu, writes markdown to `exports/` beside the index: what the preview shows, with headings levelled by each card's depth.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test          # core and view tests against an in-memory vault
npm run build     # bundles src/ into main.js
